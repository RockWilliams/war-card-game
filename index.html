        <li class="instructions__rules">Welcome to War, a classic two player card game. Today you will be playing againstthe computer! Your goal in the game is to reduce the number of cards in your opponent's deck to 0 before they do the same to you. Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack. If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up one card face down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles (six cards).
        </li>
        <br />
        <li class="instructions__how">To start the game click the Deal button to split, and shuffle the deck into each of your hands. Next, click the Draw button to draw a card and play it. Clear will move the cards to the winner's hand, but if there is a war an alert will pop up and 3 more cards will be drawn; press clear again after the war cards are distributed to clear the 6 cards to the winner.
